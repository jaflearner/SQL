#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

/* What columns are in the customers table */

  SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
  LIMIT 20;
/* what columns are in the customers table? */
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

/* How many orders were placed in January? */
  SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
  SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 
  SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

    SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers 
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID; 
  
4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

  SELECT DISTinct(product), price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
 (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products). 

  SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, product
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many 
  of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 

  SELECT product,SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, location FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
  GROUP BY product;

 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February,
 and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
 
   SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum),
  AVG(quantity)*price AS average
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS febsales
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS customers 
  ON  febsales.orderID = customers.order_id
  WHERE febsales.Quantity > 2;
  
    /*  List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. */

SELECT product,SUM(quantity), location FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;


#1 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT DISTINCT location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
HAVING COUNT(orderID) > 2;


#2 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

#3 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hint: For this question,
we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account).
SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#4 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
(Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#5 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, 
sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc 
LIMIT 1;
