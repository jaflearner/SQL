#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

/* What columns are in the customers table */

  SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
  LIMIT 20;
/* what columns are in the customers table? */
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

/* How many orders were placed in January? */
  SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
  SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
 
  SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

    SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers 
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID; 
  
4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

  SELECT DISTinct(product), price
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
 (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products). 

  SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, product
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  GROUP BY product;

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many 
  of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 

  SELECT product,SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue, location FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
  GROUP BY product;

 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February,
 and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
 
   SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum),
  AVG(quantity)*price AS average
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS febsales
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS customers 
  ON  febsales.orderID = customers.order_id
  WHERE febsales.Quantity > 2;
