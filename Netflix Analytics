In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data.

/* compined united two tables */
  SELECT people.show_id, people.director, titles.title, titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id; 

# 1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) */
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
WHERE titles.type = 'Movie'; 


# 2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
 SELECT MAx(date(date_added))
  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles; 


# 3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
 SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
ORDER BY type; 

/* SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
ORDER BY titles ASC; */


# 4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? */
 SELECT titles.title, people.director   FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';


# 5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?  */
 SELECT  MIN(release_year), title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
GROUP BY title,  release_year
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1 ;
